# ToDoManager

This is my first C# project, a part of my journey to learn .NET framework. It's a simple CRUD application used to manage tasks through CLI.

App Features:
1- Create Task: Add new task and give it a name.
2- List Tasks: show all the created tasks.
3- Update Task: Mark task as completed.
4- Delete Task: Delete the task and update the list of tasks accordingly.
